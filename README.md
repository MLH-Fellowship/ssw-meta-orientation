## About It
This is a Cooking Assistant App that allows you to  move between the recipe steps without using your hands while you cook your favorite meals. In order to do this, the app has integrated voice control so you can move between recipe steps.  <br />

It has as an objective to be a simple and UX friendly app that helps you mean while you cook your favorite meals.

## Project Development
Android Studio was the IDE that we used to build this app. First we design a simple UI for the user that is intuitive and clean, then we put our hands on coding to build it. We use only Kotlin as the coding language. For the voice control integration we did a bast research of libraries that we could use, because we needed to leave the microphone open more than the usual in order to fulfill our needs.<br />

The user selects a recipe from the explorer and then the detailed recipe view is open. In the detail view you can see the ingredients and the procedure recipe steps. If you want to use the voice control sistem just click on the microphone button. To move forward say "next" if you want to go back just say "back".
